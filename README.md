# ASH_Extractor
Fixed version of crediar's ASH0 by PMArkive. I simply changed the file structure and added a Makefile for easily compilation on Linux.

Archived in favor of the brand new and much better code over at [https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/ASH0-tools](https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/ASH0-tools), so please check that repository out instead.
